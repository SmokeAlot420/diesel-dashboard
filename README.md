# Context Engineering Hub

A comprehensive collection of context engineering frameworks and templates designed to help AI coding assistants deliver production-ready code on the first pass.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Browse our [PRP Templates](./prp-templates/) to find the right framework for your project.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

This repository contains several specialized directories:

- **[PRP Templates](./prp-templates/)** - Context engineering templates for different use cases
- **[Slash Commands](./slash-commands/)** - Ready-to-use Claude Code commands for development workflows
- **[Global Rules](./global-rules/)** - Reusable AI coding rules and configurations (Archon, .cursorrules, etc.)
- **[Claude Hooks](./claude-hooks/)** - Event hooks and logging for Claude Code actions

## üìö What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering represents a paradigm shift from traditional prompt engineering:

### Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering:**

- Focuses on clever wording and specific phrasing
- Limited to how you phrase a task
- Like giving someone a sticky note

**Context Engineering:**

- A complete system for providing comprehensive context
- Includes documentation, examples, rules, patterns, and validation
- Like writing a full screenplay with all the details

### Why Context Engineering Matters

1. **Reduces AI Failures**: Most agent failures aren't model failures - they're context failures
2. **Ensures Consistency**: AI follows your project patterns and conventions
3. **Enables Complex Features**: AI can handle multi-step implementations with proper context
4. **Self-Correcting**: Validation loops allow AI to fix its own mistakes
